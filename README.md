## Manual Installation (Alternative)

If you prefer to install from the source code, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lgoio/RecentItems.git
   cd RecentItems
   make install

## Important: This extension is not on extensions.gnome.org for now

### Why?

This extension is a fork of bananenfisch's RecentItems and was originally intended for integration into the original project.
However, due to time constraints, the maintainer was unable to thoroughly review the changes,
which is why he ultimately rejected them.
Therefore, at his request, this extension remains a hard fork.
And because this extension is still fairly new, I want to fix all bugs before releasing it on extensions.gnome.org.

## Recent Items - an extension for gnome-shell
